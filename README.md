## TyepeScript? ü§î

### What Is It

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language and it compiles to plain old JavaScript. This means that if you already know how to write JavaScript, you already know how to write TypeScript! Simply rename your `.js` and `.jsx` files to `.ts` and `.tsx`, respectively.

### Why Use It

JavaScript is a notoriously difficult language to debug. It offers little to none compile-time checks, and it's up to the developer to find and fix errors encountered at runtime. This is where TypeScript's type system comes in - it will help you catch bugs early at compile time. I can't emphasize this enough - **TypeScript will save you significant time from manually debugging your code. If your TypeScript code compiles, you can be very certain that it will work as expected.**

There are several other reasons to choose TypeScript: it supports latest ECMAScript features while providing backward compatibility with older browsers, there is amazing IDE and tooling support for it, most of the widely used node packages provide their types so that you can use them with TypeScript, and its code is all [open-sourced](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript), backed by Microsoft!

The developer community loves TypeScript ‚ô•Ô∏èüòç. Don't believe me? TypeScript was the [second most loved language in Stack Overflow's 2020 Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages-loved), beating out Python, Java, JavaScript, etc. Two out of the three front-end framework titans - [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular) and [Vue.js 3.0](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next) - are primarily written in TypeScript (the [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) team also embraces types, but through [Flow](https://flow.org), which is a static type checker for JavaScript).

### So What's the Catch?

To fully utilize the power of TypeScript, you will have to learn its type system. It's not complicated and will remind you of Java. I would recommend [this](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/typescript/) as a resource for learning the type system, and [this](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet/blob/master/README.md#section-2-getting-started) as a cheat sheet for using TypeScript with React.

**This project also includes an [example](components/MyDummyComponent.tsx) of a strictly typed React functional component.**

**As an example of a production ready Next.js + TypeScript (+ MongoDB + Material-UI) app, refer to the DMS project [repository](https://github.com/GTBitsOfGood/dms).**

## Development

The following is auto-generated from `create-next-app`.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/import?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
